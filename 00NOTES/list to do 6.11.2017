Need images on home page â€“ Dana to help source them. Jason will put some on my Google doc to see what he was looking at.

Home page images - cartoons trivialize the work. Nothing too cartoony. Dana is going to see if she can find some images that might work. She also wants to see what we've been thinking about using. We're supposed to paste some ideas into the shared google doc. Don't paste anything that is obviously a security cliche like a lock or a shield.
